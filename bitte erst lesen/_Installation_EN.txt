1. installation on the webserver

   1.1 Create MYSQL database
  
   1.2 Transfer files via FTP to the webspace and set file permissions
       Please pay attention to the following:
       - Transfer mode binary
       - If your FTP client program has a setting that upper case letters are converted to lower case letters, deactivate this option!
       - If you use FileZilla, please make sure that after the transfer of the files no files are listed in the tab "Failed transfers".
         otherwise select all of them and add them to the queue again by right-clicking on them and
         right-click the files in the "Files to be transferred" tab to process the queue again. Repeat this process as often
         until no more files are listed in the "Failed transfers" tab.
       The installer shows whether the file permissions need to be adjusted at all

   1.3 Run web based installation routine
       (Attention: No .htaccess directory protection must be set on the store directory).
       To do this, enter the SHOP URL in the browser and add /_installer, then follow the instructions in the installer.
  
       Assign rights after installation for the configure files for security purposes!

       File rights function
       /includes/configure.php 444 Configuration file Shop
  
   1.4 Delete the "_installer" directory of the installer


2. set up search engine friendly URLs (optional)

   If "Shopstat" is to be used to create search engine friendly URLS,
   the following requirements must be met:

   2.1 The server must support "mod_rewrite". 
       (see Administration -> Utilities -> Server info) 
   
   2.2 Activate "Search Engine Friendly URLS" in the admin area 
       (Advanced Configuration -> Meta-Tags/Search Engines -> 
        Use search engine friendly URLs -> "true")
   
   2.3 Rename the "_.htaccess" in the main directory of the store to ".htaccess".

   If your store is located in a subfolder (e.g. http://domain.de/shop/ ),
   you have to edit the .htaccess file and change the "RewriteBase" according to the instructions 
   in the file.

3. after the installation

   3.1 If the store was installed completely, you can now create or import categories and articles. 
       can be created or imported.
       More information about this and the general configuration of the store itself can be found in the 
       in the modified eCommerce Shopsoftware user manual at:
       https://new-business-consulting.de/modified-eCommerce-Shopsoftware-Handbuch:::2.html
  
   3.2 Help with customizing / updating the template is available at:
       https://www.modified-shop.org/forum/index.php?topic=1040.0


4. important note

   Again and again we see that HTML or PHP files are edited with programs like Microsoft Word or
   OpenOffice are edited. These are not suitable editors and errors will occur!
